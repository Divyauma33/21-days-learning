While loop
 Definition:
    A While loop repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true.
    Used when we don't know exactly how many times it will run.

 Syntax:
    while(condition){

    }  

How it Works:
    Check condition
    If True -> execute
    Update variable
    Repeat  

Do-While loop:
 Definition:
    A do while loop executes the code at least once,even if condition is false.

Syntax:

do{

}while(condition);

 1. Executes first,check later
 2.Runs at least once.
