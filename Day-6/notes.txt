What is Switch Statement?
 Definition:

Switch is a decision-making statement used to select one option from multiple fixed choices.

It is cleaner than multiple if-else if when checking:

Menu options

Fixed values

User choices

Days, months, operators

2️. Syntax of Switch:

switch (expression) {

    case value1:
        // code
        break;

    case value2:
        // code
        break;

    default:
        // runs if no case matches
}

Important Rules:

1. Expression must return:

int

char

String (Java 7+)

2. break is very important
3. default is optional but recommended
4. Case values must be constant
